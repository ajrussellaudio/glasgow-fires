# :fire: Glasgow Fires :fire:

This is a map of fires in Glasgow, because we seem to have so many that it's hard to keep track.

This is built with a Ruby on Rails API, with Active Admin. The `client` folder is a React app, with LeafletJS for the map.

## To do:

- Add more incidents
- Add news sources for each fire
- Make it look dope
